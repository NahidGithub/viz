We will build two pipelines- one that runs just a selected estimator and one that will include a SelectFromModel step prior to modeling our data. We will write our scores to a file that we can use for creating plots comparing the models.\n",

    "This lab borrows heavily from the [Census notebook](https://github.com/georgetown-analytics/machine-learning/tree/master/examples/bbengfort/census) we reviewed at the end of the machine learning class. We did this to reinforce the concepts we went over in Machine Learning and to show you another way to adapt that code to different data. We are going to use a different UCI data set in this exercise-- the Mushroom Data Set. Our objective is to predict if a mushroom is poisionous or edible based on its characteristics. \n",
